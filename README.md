This is a Machine Learning Model to predict the future sales of television,radio,newspaper etc.. This model can be Implemented using IDE's Like VS Code,PyCharm,ananconda,etc.. To Run this model Install the Following Python Packages: 1)numpy 2)pandas 3)Sklearn

How To install these packages:

In VS Code: To install Python libraries in Visual Studio Code, create a virtual environment using "python -m venv" command, copy the project folder path, create a virtual environment using "v env", download the required library using "pip install", and run the code.

Another Method: To install a package that includes a setup.py file, open a command or terminal window and: cd into the root directory where setup.py is located. Enter: python `m pip install package name.

In PyCharm: Install a package on a virtual environment. Press Ctr+Alt To open the IDE settings and then select Project | Python Interpreter. Expand the list of the available interpreters and click Show All. Show all available interpreters Locate the target interpreter and press edit interpreter. Discover the interpreter path for the selected venv.Copy or memorize the path of the virtual environment and close the dialogs.

Open the terminal and run the following commands:

source /bin/activate pip install Installing a Python package on a virtual environment Inspect and parse the results.

After Installing the required Packages,Load the Dataset into the ML Model.
